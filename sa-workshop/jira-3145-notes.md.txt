Hi team,

Since Docker technology gives versioned app with data as container/images, it helps our daily dev activities for following reasons:

to keep individual mongo container per app with its own data and launch paired with the application at any time

to launch even production SA container'zed apps locally without building anything locally

to launch/use any third party services liek local S3 or mock services

as Pod/container based Kubernetes is the future

If interested

I am thinking of spending couple of hours/week to get a simple workshop, if interested to jumpstart use of docker for your daily dev or devops work, you are welcome to join

And I encourage people to attend if and only if you are going to make use and get benefits from it.

Please do not spend time, to know the technology like webinar, since this will be workshop where we would be running example to get familiar

Aim of this workshop is to get you to very basics, then you can cruise the boat on your own  

The brief approach of workshop:

Day.1) Install DockerDesktop or Oracle VirtualBox

Please complete this on your own by July 15th;

Day.1.Step.1) Install Docker-Desktop for non-linux desktops following https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

If you have issues installing in Windows, the best option is to just install Oracle Virtual Box and Get Unbuntu 10.04 server as guest

Day.1.Step.2) Test you can run hello-world like it shows, without sudo https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#test-docker-installation

Day.2) First workshop - docker Images

Hoping to do this first meeting/hands-on this July Friday 17th, 2020

Step.1) Basics of "Docker Technology" 

know about - engine (daemon) or docker cli

Difference between VM's and Containers with examples

Docker images, using  - pull, run, stop and rmi

Step.2) docker containers

Step.3) docker volume
